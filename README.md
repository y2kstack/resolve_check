You are correct that on Linux, when the /etc/resolv.conf file changes, 
it may be necessary to call res_init() to reload the resolver information. However, 
the Resolv library in Ruby does not provide a direct method to call res_init().





The `res_init()` function is part of the C library function set for DNS resolver operations. It is typically provided by the operating system's resolver library, which is responsible for handling DNS resolution and name resolution related tasks.

The `res_init()` function is used to initialize the resolver library's internal data structures and configuration based on the contents of the `/etc/resolv.conf` file. It is often called when the resolver configuration changes or when a program starts up and needs to ensure that the resolver is properly initialized.

In the context of programming with DNS resolution, including the `Resolv` library in Ruby, the `res_init()` function is typically called by the operating system's resolver library or by lower-level networking functions. It is responsible for loading and updating the resolver information, including the DNS server addresses and domain search lists.

Please note that the availability and behavior of `res_init()` may vary depending on the operating system and resolver implementation being used.
